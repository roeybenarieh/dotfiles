## what the f\*\*ck is this repo about?

You probably used vscode/pycharm, and you are asking yourself what is the point
of life? Why am I being drag down by this IDE ðŸ˜ž

Say hello to RoeyLazyVim!  
The only IDE that doesn't make you shoot yourself in the foot while
you're using it.
It has everything you used to and even more!

Already have some experience with vi/vim? Great! This IDE is just for you!

## I'm stack, what should I do?

If you want to do anything,
there is a good chance it's already supported by the IDE.  
A few tricks to find staff you want to do:

- type \<leader>sk (\<leader> is the space key),
  this will give you a interface to search for keymaps.
- type :h followed by the plugin name, this will open the plugin's documentation.
- search online, there is a large Neovim community at you command!
- read the LazyVim documentation given above,
  it might help you understand if what you want already exists,
  and if not how to add it (and create a PRðŸ˜Š)
